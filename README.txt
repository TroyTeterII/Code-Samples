Hello, thank you for viewing my github respository Code-Samples.

Here you will find a collection of codes that I have written. They are not meant to be used in conjuction.
They are simply illustrastions of my ability to develop software solutions using python.
Most of these files were written in python 2.7, some in python 3.

Most of these functions involve extracting and manipulating data from various forms.
100% of the code in this folder was written without AI or from copy pasting stack overflow answers etc.
